## Overview

**ThermaLeaf Panels™** are **decorative, self-regulating wall panels** that use **plant-derived phase-change materials (PCMs)** and **mycelium air filters** to **stabilize indoor temperatures naturally**, reducing the need for HVAC systems.  

Each panel can **absorb heat during the day** and **release it at night** (or vice versa, depending on climate), while **purifying the air of particulates and VOCs**. Designed for **homeowners and businesses**, they help cut **heating and cooling costs by up to 40%** while improving air quality.

---

## Core Features

- **Energy-Free Climate Control** – PCMs store and release heat, keeping rooms comfortable.  
- **Air Purification** – Integrated **mycelium-biochar core** filters pollutants and CO₂.  
- **Customizable Aesthetic** – Available in wood, stone, or living moss finishes.  
- **Low-Maintenance** – Panels require **only yearly refresh kits** for PCM and biofilters.  
- **Quick Installation** – Mounts like a decorative panel, with **no electrical hookups**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Phase-Change Core** – Plant-based PCM absorbs excess heat (liquefies) when the room is warm, and releases heat (solidifies) when it cools.  
2. **Mycelium-Biochar Filter Layer** – Passively filters indoor air as natural convection flows through the panel.  
3. **Thermal Buffering** – Reduces temperature swings, cutting HVAC usage significantly.  
4. **Optional Smart Add-On** – IoT sensor kit can track energy savings and indoor air quality.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Plant-derived PCMs (e.g., coconut or soy-based).  
  - Mycelium-biochar composite filter layer.  
  - Recycled wood or bamboo panel casings.

- **Production**:  
  - Can be produced in **standard furniture or panel factories**.  
  - Cost to produce: **$15–$30 per panel**.  
  - Retail price: **$60–$120**, with optional **smart sensor upsell**.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Suitable for **global distribution via home stores and green building suppliers**.  
  - DAO-driven microfactory kits enable **local assembly hubs** for emerging markets.

---

## Use Cases

- **Homes & Apartments** – Reduce reliance on heaters and AC units.  
- **Offices & Commercial Spaces** – Lower operational energy costs.  
- **Eco-Renovations** – Quick retrofit for sustainable upgrades.  
- **Tiny Homes & Cabins** – Ideal for **off-grid living** with passive comfort.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Reduces **heating and cooling energy by 25–40%**, lowering grid demand.  
- Filters indoor air pollutants, improving health and wellness.  
- All materials are **renewable, compostable, or recyclable** at end of life.  
- Each panel offsets **~0.5–1 ton of CO₂ annually** through energy savings and carbon-capturing filter cores.
